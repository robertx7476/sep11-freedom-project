# Entry 2
##### 12/9/24-12/15/24

### Context
In this blog, I will be writing about a month's work of learning my tool and then I am going to write about what are my plans for the fp during winter break.

### Content
I learn many new things from Impact, but also there is stuff repeated from class. I saw tutorials on how to make a few games in Impact. A game that I was following along in Impact was somebody making a game of pong. I followed along the code, but I changed a few things. For example the pngs used in the tutorial I didn't use, I used different pngs, and I chose interesting images. I chose frying pans as the paddles for the pong, but I don't know why I put a basketball as the ball for the game. `animSheet: new ig.AnimationSheet( 'media/basketball.jpeg', 48, 48),`

But when I finished following along the tutorial, at the end, the person created a map in weltmeister.html. So I went to the terminal and did **http-server** to go follow along. But we had different buttons on our weltmeisters, so I couldn't follow along. Also another reason I couldn't follow along in weltmeister was because my buttons in weltmeister doesn't work. It is unresponsive. And the creator of the tutorial never touch the weltmeister file until the end so I don't know why it is different.
Here is my log
```
### 11/18/24 - 11/25/24:
- The link to the tutorial that I was using is (https.//www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMXWImAuim8)
    - I finished the tutorial
    - made ping pong with different assets.
- Though there is a problem.
    - The game broke
    - I followed tutorial exacting, but the weltmeister.html file isn't working
    - That part is different from the tutorial even though neither of us changed it.
```
Then I saw a video on optimization in impact. It is basically a review video on what I have already learning. It talks about indentations and how to organize the files. And I saw a game where the creator had new condtions and code that I haven't seen before. Like friction, fireDelay, FireRate, Invincible, and weapon. I think that they are all variables, and it is customizable.
```
- Saw a video on optimization for impact
    - there is lots for loops, strings, and return
- Another game made with Impact had
    - Friction is used, animation, and type
    - they also named some like, fireDelay, and fireRate, Invincible, and weapon.
- Also saw how the creator used strings and arrays in their code.
- I tried fixing the weltmeister, but like I wrote before, previously didn't touch it and the first tutorial didn't touch it, yet we have different results.
- The weltmeister folder has another folder with many files.
    - Like pngs that I don't use but could be useful in the future.
```

### Plan
So the plan over the winter break for me is to start the groundwork/foundation of the game. I want to create multiple backgrounds for my group's game, and I want to code in a sprite that will be affected by gravity and friction. I won't care about how the sprite will look because I am bad at art and animation and my group members are good at drawing. I'll work with them over the break, see how they add their tools, and I want a functional world by the end of the break. Where we can move a sprite around, and maybe add a house where we can go in?
