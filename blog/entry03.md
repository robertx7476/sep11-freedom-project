# Entry 3
##### 2/3/25-2/10/25

### Context
In my third blog, I will be continuing to write about what I've learned about Impact.js.
### Content
To start, I'm a bit conflicted on if I should continue to learn Impact, or if I should change my tool. As said in my previous blog, the weltmeister.html file doesn't work the way it's supposed to or I'm missing something. I'll talk more at the end, and right now I'll talk about the next thinks I learned.

First, in a another (youtube tutorial)[https.//www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMXWImAuim8], I saw and learned new lines of codes and what goes on behind games.
- I saw that the creator of the youtube tutorial have a `ig.module{}` at the top of his main code. They added a id that says `.requires{}` and added levels.
    - the first thing in the `.requires{}` is `impact.game`
    - then there are about ten lines of code that says `game.levels.(a word)` with commas at the end.
    - They also added a camera line code that says game.`plugins.camera`, and also added other plugins.

I also noticed other new lines of code that wasn't shown in the other tutorial.

- I see a line that says `showStats:false`,
    - which I think means that it begins as you can't see your stats, but at the end you can.
- Multiple sprites and pngs connected to the sprites
- And a line that gives instructions and how long it stays on screen.
- There's also multiple timers for the game.

I think I'll mostly use timers for the crops part of my future game. Like each crop has a set amount of time it takes for it to mature and then you can pick it up.

So the creator of the (youtube tutorial)[https.//www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMXWImAuim8], explains how they made their game using impact. They talked about of they organized their layers on weltmeister, collisions, and more. But I can't do any of that, since my weltmeister file doesn't work.
### What's next
So I don't know if I should continue unless I can get the file fixed. I'll for now keep trying to get it to work, and keep learning about it. I really like the games that people had made with impact, and I want to keep going and seeing what I can make using Impact.
