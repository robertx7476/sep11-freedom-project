# Entry 6
##### 5/16/25-6/1/25

### Context
So this is the last blog of this year and of 11th grade. In this blog, I will be writing about my takeaways from my presentations. I presented with my partners multiple times, we presented in class and we also presented to other students and teachers in our school at our Expo.

### Takeaways
#### In-class presentation
The three of us made some [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12HR9RHnp62WqtHSPO8AnI9oq0q3-rLFDWaIHxF5GQ2A/edit?slide=id.g35a57763b00_0_21#slide=id.g35a57763b00_0_21) to present to our class. We all practiced a bit and we assigned each other slide numbers so we know which ones we are saying and for a few of the slides, two people spoke about it.

We all did great at presenting to our class. I introduced our slides to the class, saying our hook, then we did a live demo to the class of our game/product. We all spoke loudly and clearly to our audience and we all had decent eye contact to them. Also since we knew what we were going to say, the presentation was straight forward. And like I said before, certain parts of the slide, we divided what we were saying. So I started our takeaway slide, and my partner immediately said their part when I stopped. We also had some visuals in our slides.

Small things we could've done better was remembering to say "thank you for listening to our presentation" at the end. And another was we went two minutes over the 10 minute limit.
#### Expo elevator pitch
I think we did a good job at showing our project to other students at the expo and the judges at the expo. When the judges came, my partners were saying their quick lines and I was showing them our game. I showed them the title screen we made, then clicking brings you to the instructions screen, and then clicking again brings you to the game.

One of the judges was trying out our game, and we were also telling them additional information, like what to collect and avoid in the game, and also that there is a pause function in the game. Then after the judges left, a couple students went to our game and we pitched our game, and let them test the game out. One of the students got a high score of 117 and he was proud to be the first one to get over 20 points.

### Skills
#### Time Management
We used this skill a lot. Sometimes we successfully used this skill, sometimes we didn't. A sucess is completing and practicing our presentation so we were prepared. A almost fail was when we finished our mvp product on the last week.
