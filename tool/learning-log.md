- This week I was watching a tutorial on youtube and following along
    - I made multiple new folders and downloaded files
    - The game I was recreating is pong.
    - I added my own imgs, and I followed along with the code
- So I learned
    - how to adjust size `size: (x:48,y:48),`
    - how to add keybinds into the game
```
	init: function() {
	ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.UP_ARROW, 'up' )
	ig.input.bind( ig.KEY.DOWN_ARROW, 'down' )
},
```
- And I started learning code on how to animate
```
this.addAnim('idle',0.1, [0,1,2,3,4,4,4,4,3,2,1] );
```
- the numbers in the bracket is the frames from the animSheet.
